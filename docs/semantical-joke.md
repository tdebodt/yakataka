# A Semantical Joke

Why did the developer name their kanban app "Semantical"?

Because they wanted their tasks to have **meaning**... and also because "TaskListThatActuallyMakesYouFeelProductiveEvenWhenYoureJustMovingCardsAround" was too long for the npm package name.

*Remember: In Semantical, every card moved to "Done" is semantically equivalent to productivity.*
